Smokers Problem Solution in C++
===============================

In "The little book of semaphores by Allen B. Downey" there is an exercise in chapter 4.5 called the 'Cigarette smokers problem'.

Three versions of this problem are described in the book that are named as follows:

0. The impossible version.
0. The interesting version.
0. The trivial version.

My solution tackles the impossible first version.

Environment
-----------

The solution was created with Visual Studio Community 2015.

Usage
-----

Just compile and run in Visual Studio and the smokers will be continuously matched to the offered ingredients.
